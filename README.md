# Objective
Creating a report from millions of records and overview it without any errors is a tough challenge.
To overcome this problem DataAnalysis takes place. DataAnalysis is the process of  analysing, interpreting, 
data to discover valuable insights that drive smarter and more effective business decisions.
Data analysis tools are used to extract useful information from business and other types of 
data, and help make the data analysis process easier. Also Data visualisation help to make more effective 
business decesions.Data Visualisation is the graphical representation of information and data.By using visual 
elements like charts, graphs and maps, data visualisation tools provide an accessible way to see and understand 
trends, outliers and patterns in data.


 # Mapping into Aanalysis -
 
 Based on the objective and data given in any format like SQL Datasets, XLMX, Server, Text etc. We are supposed to extract the data, 
 cleaning the data, analyse the data and visualization of data on the basis of output objective.
 
 - ### ETL (Extract , Transfrom , Load).
   Extracting the data from different source systems, then Transforms the data (like applying calculations, concatenations, etc.) 
   and finally Loads the data into the Data Warehouse system.
 - ### Data cleaning 
   Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data 
   within a dataset.
 - ### Data Transfromation
   Data Transfromation is the process of converting data from one format to another, typically from the format of a source system 
   into the required format of a destination system. Data transformation is a component of most data integration and data management
   tasks, such as data wrangling and data warehousing.
 - ### Data Analytics
   Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data in order to make conclusions about that information. Many of the techniques and 
   processes of data analytics have been automated into mechanical processes and algorithms that work over raw data for human consumption.
